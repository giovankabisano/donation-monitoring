/* Replating the input styles from the HTML which used a form-input class? 
   The HTML has `form-input` class which usually comes from @tailwindcss/forms. 
   I should ensure I have that plugin or reproduce the styles.
   The command initialized with app-tw template which might not have forms plugin.
   I'll add the base styles for input resetting if needed, but Tailwind defaults are usually enough with class utilities. 
   However, `form-input` class specifically implies the forms plugin.
   Let's check if package.json has it. Even if not, I can just use the utility classes provided in the HTML 
   (w-full rounded-lg border-slate-200 ...). 
   Wait, the HTML uses `form-input` AND utility classes. `form-input` gives a specific look. 
   I will install @tailwindcss/forms just in case or just rely on utilities.
   Given the detailed utility classes in the HTML (border-slate-200, focus:ring-2 etc), `form-input` might be doing the base reset.
   I will just add the plugin or manual styles if it looks off. For now, I'll assume standard utilities do the job.
